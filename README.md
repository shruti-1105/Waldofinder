# Where's Waldo

Machine Learning project to find Waldo using a model trained on images labeled `waldo` and `not waldo`. Using KNN and PCA, ~93 percent accuracy was achieved after some data generation techniques.

Main notebook is [Waldo.ipynb](Waldo.ipynb) 

To see how the data was cleaned, check [Setup.ipynb](Setup.ipynb).
The notebook used for generating more Waldo images is [WaldoFindingSlices.ipynb](WaldoFindingSlices.ipynb).
